The Programme for International Student Assessment is a worldwide study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in member and non-member nations intended to evaluate educational systems by measuring 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading. I worked on analyzing the student's data to understand the effect of the number of biological parents at home on student's scores and truancy. Also, I analyzed the relation between the student skills in reading, science and maths.
